Magicians make things appear and dissapear, the `magician` package creates disposable containers in your tests. The package has been inspired by [withr](https://withr.r-lib.org/) and [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of magician from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") %>% 
devtools::install_github("szymanskir/magician")
```

## Examples

### Postgres

```r
with_postgres_connection("postgres:12.10", {
 DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "select version();")
})
```

> The `with_postgres_connection` attaches a `con` object with the Postgres connection you can use
